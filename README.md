# 1.) Project Overview

In this project, I will be working with a Zillow dataset to create a model that will predict a property's value. Specifically for this scenario... This machine learning model will predict single-unit property values that are sold during the peak season of real-estate (May-Aug) of 2017.


# 2.) Project Description

We are to build a regression model to predict a continuous variable (tax_value) using features that will help us better predict tax value. Since there are heaps of missing data, we'll have to find ways to combat it. We also want to know which counties these properties are located in and calculate tax rate.


# 3.) Goals
Deliver a Jupyter notebook going through the steps of the data science pipeline
Create a regression model that performs better than the baseline
Present to audience about my findings

# 4.) Deliverables
Finalized Jupyter notebook complete with comments
A README.md with executive summary, contents, data dictionary, conclusion and next steps, and how to recreate this project.
Presentation slide deck

# 5.) Project Summary
I built a regression model to predict single unit property values in 3 California counties using a Zillow data frame.
